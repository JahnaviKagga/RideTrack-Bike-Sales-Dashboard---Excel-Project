# 🚴 RideTrack – Bike Sales Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
The RideTrack Bike Sales Dashboard is an Excel-based interactive tool designed to help the company analyze customer demographics and purchasing patterns. It leverages **pivot tables, slicers, and charts** to provide insights into income, commute behavior, and age-related sales trends.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
RideTrack, a bike retail company, was collecting large amounts of sales and customer demographic data but lacked a **consolidated, interactive system** to derive actionable insights.  
The leadership team needed to answer questions such as:  
- Do higher-income customers purchase more bikes?  
- How does commute distance influence purchasing behavior?  
- Which age groups are driving the most sales?  

However, manual reporting was slow, non-visual, and not scalable.  
👉 A dynamic Excel dashboard was required to **analyze sales patterns, improve decision-making, and identify growth opportunities**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Bike shop sales records (cleaned in Excel).  
- **Key Columns**: Customer demographics (Age, Income, Commute Distance), Purchase data.  

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
1. **Average Income per Purchase** – identifies spending capacity of bike buyers.  
2. **Customer Commute** – analyzes commute distance to predict demand for bike types.  
3. **Customer Age Brackets** – groups customers into segments to see which age groups buy most.

## 📈 Dashboard Features
- Interactive **pivot tables & slicers** for filtering.  
- Dynamic charts to compare demographics.
